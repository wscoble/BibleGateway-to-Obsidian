# Psalms 131
***



###### 1 
O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. 

###### 2 
But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

###### 3 
O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
