# Psalms 87
***





###### 1 

His foundation is in the holy mountains. 



###### 2 

Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. 



###### 3 

Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God. Selah. 



###### 4 

I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me. Behold, Philistia, Tyre, and also Ethiopia: "This one was born there." 



###### 5 

Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one was born in her;" the Most High himself will establish her. 



###### 6 

Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah. 



###### 7 

Those who sing as well as those who dance say, "All my springs are in you."
